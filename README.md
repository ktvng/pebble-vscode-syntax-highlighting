# Pebble PL Syntax Highlighting support for VSCode

The `pebble-vscode-syntax-highlighting` extension provides ground level syntax highlighting for the Pebble programming language (currently still in beta). A TextMate grammar is used to bootstrap Pebble PL tokens onto Python tokens to achieve compatibility with most major theme providers. This extension is still in development so check frequently for updates.

## Features

Syntax highlighting is supported for all `*.pebl`, `*.peb`, `*.pebble` files. Simply install and enable the extension to start supporting Pebble syntax highlighting.
